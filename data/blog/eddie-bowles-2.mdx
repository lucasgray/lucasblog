## Walking Tour Ideas

I've considered spinning this idea out into a SaaS product. I think it'd be a fun product to create your own walking tours!

Consider -
* A unique anniversary present for your significant other. Choose locations in your town that are relevant to your relationship and make it a fun challenge with a surprise at the end! Even better, a scavenger hunt with puzzles to unlock the next waypoint.

* A celebration of life. For folks coming in from out of town, it would add more meaning to the event if you didn't know the person very well. And something to bond over with the other attendees.

* Tourism. A draw and reason to visit a location. For example, a driving tour around Hawaii's Big Island or a tour around food & drink establishments in Wisconsin's Door County.
