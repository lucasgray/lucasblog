I'm a dude that likes building software. By day, I enjoy helping others bring the software of their dreams to life. I relentlessly chase process optimization.  By night, I poke around creating games with Unity, Phaser.js, and react-native.

I lead engineering teams. I strive to create a team culture of high trust and low ego. I believe that the pursuit of the **craftsmanship** of building software is key to producing the best work of one's career.

During my free time I build software for fun (noticing the trend?). I have several projects on the front and back burners that consume much of my time. Currently, I'm primarily invested in a tactical RPG pixel game called Advent of the Reaper, but several other projects come and go.

I'm also a runner, fisher, cyclist, husband, and cat dad.
