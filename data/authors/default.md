I'm a dude that likes building software. By day, I enjoy helping others bring the software of their dreams to life. I relentlessly chase process optimization.  By night, I poke around creating games with Unity.

During my free time I build software for fun (notice the trend yet?). I have several projects on the front and back burners that consume much of my time. Currently, I'm primarily invested in a tactical RPG pixel game called Advent of the Reaper, but several other projects come and go.

I'm also a runner, fisher, cyclist, husband, and cat dad.
